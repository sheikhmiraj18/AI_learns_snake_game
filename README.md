# AI-Powered Snake Game Using Reinforcement Learning

Developed a reinforcement learning AI agent to play the classic Snake game using Python, PyTorch, and Pygame. Designed and implemented a deep Q-network (DQN) to enable the AI to learn optimal strategies through trial and error. The project involved setting up the game environment, creating the neural network architecture, and applying reinforcement learning techniques to train the agent. Conducted extensive experimentation and hyperparameter tuning to enhance the performance of the AI. Successfully demonstrated the AI's capability to achieve high scores autonomously, showcasing proficiency in machine learning, neural networks, and game development.
